The different types of laws in India can be broadly categorized as follows:

1. **Constitutional Law**: Governs the interpretation and implementation of the Indian Constitution. It defines the structure, powers, and functions of the government and safeguards fundamental rights of citizens.

2. **Criminal Law**: Deals with offenses against the state or society, such as theft, murder, rape, and assault. It prescribes punishments and procedural laws under codes like the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).

3. **Civil Law**: Handles disputes between individuals or organizations related to contracts, property, family issues, torts, etc. It focuses on compensation or specific remedies rather than punishments and is governed by laws such as the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC).

4. **Common Law (Judicial Precedent)**: Based on judicial decisions and court precedents, providing consistency and filling gaps where statutory laws are silent.

5. **Statutory Law**: These are laws enacted by the Parliament or state legislatures, including acts covering areas such as labor law, tax law, environmental law, and company law.

6. **Administrative Law**: Regulates government agencies and their interactions with citizens, ensuring lawful and fair administration.

7. **Family or Personal Law**: Deals with personal matters like marriage, divorce, inheritance, and adoption, often varying based on religious communities (Hindu, Muslim, Christian, etc.).

Additionally, some other specialized laws in India include:

- **Tax Law** (e.g., Income Tax Act, GST Act)
- **Corporate Law** (e.g., Companies Act)
- **Environmental Law** (e.g., Environment Protection Act)
- **Cyber Law** (e.g., Information Technology Act)
- **Consumer Protection Law** (e.g., Consumer Protection Act)
- **Labour Law**

Indiaâ€™s legal system is a hybrid of civil law, common law, statutory law, customary law, and religious law, reflecting the country's diverse social fabric and constitutional framework.

This classification covers the major branches and key legislations governing law in India[1][2][3][4][5].
